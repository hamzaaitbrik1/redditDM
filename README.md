# What's new?
Changed the technology to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) for maximum efficiency.

# Importnat
There are two versions of the bot, [Selenium](https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot/tree/selenium) and [Playwright](https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot). Both versions of the bot are tested 14th of February, 2024; both are working. **Playwright version performs better than Selenium.**<br>
This bot was developed on a Linux machine, it may need some modifications to work on a Windows machine. Mainly link structure.

# In progress
Add a UI(User Interface). I haven't started working on this, I think the bot will remain a CLI-only tool for now.

# Prerequisites
0 - Have ```Python``` and ```Pip``` installed. This project was developed with Python 3.11.8<br>
1 - Clone this repository running the command ```git clone https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot.git``` or simply [Download it](https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot/archive/refs/heads/playwright.zip).<br>
2 - Install ```Pipenv``` using the command ```pip install pipenv```.<br>
3 - Run ```pipenv install``` inside the project to install its dependencies.<br>
4 - Run ```playwright install Chromium``` or ```python -m playwright install Chromium``` to install Playwright dependencies(browser).<br>

# How to use
1 - Add accounts to ```rdt/account.json```. Refer to [rdt/README](https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot/blob/playwright/rdt/README.md) to see how to properly add accounts.<br>
2 - Change what needs to be changed in ```rsrc/config.json```. Refer to [rsrc/README](https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot/blob/playwright/rsrc/README.md) to see how to change values to meet your needs.<br>
3 - Fill ```db/usernames.csv``` with all the usernames you want to DM.<br>
4 - Run ```RedditDMBot.py```.

# How does it work?
RedditDMBot is a bot made for the purpouse of automating the process of sending messages to Reddit users<br>
What the bot does:<br>
0 - The bot checks whether you have a proxy in ```rsrc/config.json```, all actions will be made through the proxy if found. Refer to [rsrc/README](https://github.com/hamzaaitbrik/RedditDMBot/blob/playwright/rsrc/README.md) to better understand how to properly add a proxy.<br>
1 - Logs into one of the Reddit account in ```accounts.json```.<br>
2 - Navigates to chat page.<br>
3 - Checks if the user already received a message.<br>
4 - Sends a message to the user.<br>
5 - Deletes the user from the list of users to DM and adds it to ```db/usernames_sent.csv```.<br>
6 - Logs out of the account used to DM the user.<br>
7 - Remove it from the list of available accounts and add it to a list of used accounts.<br>
8 - Logs into another Reddit account that wasn't used.<br>
9 - If there are no many available accounts, the bot reuses the used accounts until all users on your ```db/usernames.csv``` received DMs.
